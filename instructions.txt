1. Install letsencrypt on mac:
	 brew install letsencrypt

2. create a directory 
	mkdir ~/letsencrypt
	cd ~/letsencrypt

3. run the following command
   
   certbot certonly \
    --manual \
    --preferred-challenges=dns \
    --email your_email@terasrl.it \
    --agree-tos \
    --config-dir ./config \
    --logs-dir ./logs \
    --work-dir ./workdir \
    -d www.beeta.services

4. Deploy the TXT DNS record to Amazon AWS
	go to Route53 -> Hosted Zone -> beeta.services

	Click add record -> Choose type TXT

         Name of Record:  _acme-challenge.www.beeta.services
         Value of Record: <Value you got from the previous stage>

	Wait a minute or so for the propagation of DNS record, you can check on google if the record is propagated 
		https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.www.beeta.services

5. You should have all your certificates inside ~/letsencrypt/config/archive/www.beeta.services folder, 4 files

6. Copy these files into your AWS machine  	 
	scp -i /Users/tera/Desktop/Beeta_server/beeta_server.pem -r ~/letsencrypt/config/archive/www.beeta.services ubuntu@<AWS_ELASTIC_IP>:/home/ubuntu

7. You should import the created certificates to the AWS certificate Manager
	Go to AWS Certificate Manager -> Certificati
	
	If a record exists for www.beeta.services Delete those records.
	Note: If Amazon says Certificates are in use and you can not delete them You should go to Load Balancer of EC2
	
	7.1 Go to EC2 -> Load Balancers
		Select BeetaServicesLb
	
		You see two listeners on the Panel Below. The One for HTTPS:443 has an associated certificate Which is (www.beeta.services)
		Delete that Listener.

	We will continue with Load Balancer Listener a bit later.

8. Go back to AWS Certificate Manager
	Request a new Certificate 
		Select Request a public certificate 
		Next page put www.beeta.services inside the Name of Domain Box
		Select Validation with DNS (Default option)
		Dont change anything else and create the certificate.
		Amazon shows a green box on top that says View Created Certificate
		Click on the green box and Save the CNAME Record Name and Record Value of that certificate

9. Go to Route53 -> Hosted Zone -> Beeta.services again
	Add a Record 
	Choose type CNAME
	Put as the Name of Record the CNAME Name, and value the CNAME value from previous step	
	Wait for a minute for propagation, then go on AWS Certificate Manager, the certificate should be in 'Emesso' or Emmited State Which a green checkmark

10. Import Created Certificates in Step 3 to AWS Certificate Manager
	Select checkbox of the Created Certificate for www.beeta.services
	Click Import Certificate on the left panel
	You will see 3 Boxes on the web page One for certificate(cert.pem), one for private key(privkey.pem) and last one for fullchain(fullchain.pem).
	
	first cat ~/letsencrypt/config/archive/cert1.pem and put the value inside the first AWS webpage box
	second cat ~/letsencrypt/config/archive/privkey1.pem and put the value inside the 2nd AWS webpage box
	lastly cat ~/letsencrypt/config/archive/fullchain.pem and put the value inside the 3rd AWS webpage box
	
	If you have done the steps correctly generated certificate should be imported inside AWS Certificate public.
	Now You should see two certifiactes, One of Type Imported and other Of type Released by Amazon
	Remember the Certificate ID of the one Released by Amazon for next step
	
	
10. Assign the Certificate to the Load Balancer
	Go back to EC2 -> Load Balancers 
	Select Load Balancer, Click Add listener
	Select HTTPS:443
	Select the Forwarding
	Select the Certificate ID from the previous step (released by Amazon)
	Finish the Setup

11. Go to the AWS EC2 machine in console
	COPY the 4 cert files inside the fodler /home/ubuntu/www.beeta.services/ (created in step 6) to the 
		/home/ubuntu/remote-backend/beetaRemoteBackEnd/data/certbot/conf/live/www.beeta.services folder, remember if the name of the files are privkey1.pem remove the 1
		from them

12. Once finished you just have to Clean all previous dockers, remove the previous volumens and run
      sudo docker-compose up

13. Voila ... You should have SSL enabled on your server.
